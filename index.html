                                Hello, my name is Alyssa and I am a full-stack developer from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I've been working 
                                in the software field for around five years and have learned a lot along the way. I currently work as a 
                                full-stack web developer and scrum master at Our Sunday Visitor making custom software solutions for 
                                thousands of non-profit organizations nationwide.

                            <p>
                                I consider myself a full-stack developer because I have worked extensively with both the front-end and the back-end 
                                in web applications, but I also have a passion for areas outside of web development. I'm always looking for a 
                                challenge and would love to branch out into other industries such as DevOps, Graphics, and AI.

                        <br /><br />
                        In August 2011 I started pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. Prior to college, 
                        I had very minimal experience with coding. I would play with the markup on my MySpace page and sometimes tinker with 
                        a website's source code, but nothing that would qualify as programming. My first encounter with programming was my CS 160 
                        course at Purdue. It was very overwhelming and intimidating at first and I worked a lot with the teaching assisstant to 
                        get the basics down, but once I did everything just clicked. It was as if I was in a dark room full of doors and opening 
                        them one at a time to let light in. Then finally I found a way to open all the doors at once and I could finally see how 
                        everything worked together. It was this feeling that hooked me. I was determined to learn more.

                        <br /><br />
                        After gaining enough knowledge from my first two years of school, I got tired of waiting tables and decided to apply for a 
                        software job. I got a call back from Medical Informatics Engineering (MIE) and got hired directly after the interview for a part-time position.
                        I was officially a part of the IT field. I worked on code for the WebChart and NoMoreClipboard projects. These are cloud based EMR/EHR systems built 
                        for physician, patient, and enterprise use. I specifically worked with data imports involving string parsing data in JSON and XML, AJAX requests, 
                        and user input. I also updated the architecture and design of the application's system settings to be more accessible and manageable in the 
                        UI using JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, and HTML. I gained a lot work experience here specifically in C, jQuery, Git, and MySQL.

                        <br /><br />
                        While still attending school and working at MIE, I was asked to participate in a research project with three other students led by one of my professors, 
                        Dr. Britton Wolfe. I accepted gratefully and was very honored since I admired Dr. Wolfe and he was one of my favorite professors. The project was to research 
                        Android Malware. The idea was to take an Android app and be able to tell if it was malicious or not. We split up into two groups testing two different 
                        methodologies for differentiating the data. This research led to Dr. Wolfe contributing to two publications,
                        <a href="http://www.gcc.edu/Home/News-Archive/News-Article/britton-d-wolfe">
                            "High Precision Screening for Android Malware with Dimensionality Reduction,"
                        </a> and
                        <a href="http://www.gcc.edu/Home/News-Archive/News-Article/britton-d-wolfe">
                            "Comprehensive Behavior Profiling for Proactive Android Malware Detection."
                        </a>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">WoundView</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        My senior year I worked on my Capstone project, WoundView, leading a team of four and working with Purdue University and Parkview Mirro Center for Research and Innovation.
                        This was a full year project with research done in the Summer, documentation written in the Fall and Winter, and code implemented in the Spring.
                        The goal of the project was to improve the current standard of wound assessment.
                        <br /><br />
                        We did research in photogrammetry technology to be able to make measurements
                        of length and width of a wound via an image. We then took this research and created a web application that implemented it using OpenCV, Python, Flask, 
                        and Javscript/jQuery. This was where I really dived into the infrastructure behind a website since I needed to set up my own server using Ubuntu 14 Trusty Tahr,
                        Nginx, and a free DNS service. I implemented all of this during the Winter and then moved to the cloud in the Spring using AWS's free tier.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Graduated from Purdue University</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        After five strenuous years of hard work, I had finally accomplished all of the requirements needed to receive a B.S. in Computer Science and 
                        a minor in Mathematics. I was officially a graduate and ready to take on the next step.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Our Sunday Visitor</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        After graduating, I sent out many applications to get a full-time position. I had several interviews and finally made the decision to work full-time as an 
                        Associate Software Developer at Our Sunday Visitor (OSV). The first week or so was used to train and learn their tech stack which consisted of Ruby on Rails, 
                        React, and PostgreSQL. I was able to quickly ramp up and start working on defects. It wasn't long before I started knocking out my own features. My manager 
                        and others saw my progress and offered me a promotion to Software Developer after only a year. I worked with both on-site and remote workers developing what 
                        would be the beginning of OSV Hub.
                        <br /><br />
                        After about a year of that, OSV decided to redesign OSV Hub with a Microsoft stack. We switched to a .NET Core back-end and an Angular front-end. I trained and was able to quickly learn on the job once again. We were running at a status quo for some time, so I started 
                        volunteering when ever possible to help out and gain some responsibility. My manager recognized this and asked me to be the new Scrum Master. I delightfully 
                        accepted and have been managing the team processes since.
                        <br /><br />
                        Another opportunity arose when the developers responsible for the OSV Hub release process were pulled away to other requirements and they asked for 
                        volunteers to take over. I immediately stepped up since I had been interested in learning more about the release process for some time and it was 
                        another way to gain more experience. Since then I've been carrying out the day to day processes and still continue to look for any new 
                        opportunities as they come.

                <p>
                    I first started programming back in August 2011 when I enrolled at Purdue University's Fort Wayne Campus majoring in 
                    Computer Science. It wasn't long before I decided to put myself out there and start my career while still in school. 
                    I was fortunate enough to be offered a part-time position at Medical Informatics Engineering (MIE) when I was only 
                    just a sophomore. During my time at school I was part of many projects, but I consider the ones listed on my timeline 
                    to be the most beneficial to my development as a software developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I graduated from Purdue, I sent out
                    applications for a full-time position. I got a job as a full-time Associate Software Developer at Our Sunday Visitor (OSV). 
                    I made quick progress and am now a Software Developer and Scrum Master for the OSV Hub project. I have learned a lot from 
                    OSV, but I am ready for a new challenge.

                <p>
                    Labeling myself as a software developer can be limiting in all the interests I have related to the entire IT field. Of 
                    course I love being a developer, but I also am passionate about all the building blocks that make development possible. The servers, 
                    databases, and other intricate details that make up the infrastructure behind a website are just as intriguing to me. 
                    That's why I took responsible of the weekly release process for OSV Hub and why I have been experimenting with AWS. 
                    Artificial Intelligence is another area I've been exploring and have a fondness for. I've been working on a project 
                    in Amazon SageMaker that makes use of this.

                    When I'm not hacking away at code, I'm spending time with my dog, Ranger (pictured right), or my fiancé, Nathan.
                    We like to watch TV shows such as Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, The Good Place, and many more. When it's just me, I 
                    enjoy playing my guitar, reading, or playing video games like Spiderman and Red Dead Redemption 2
